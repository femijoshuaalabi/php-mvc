# php-mvc
This is just a simple PHP Model View Controller (MVC).

1. Download and exact the file to your project directory.

2. Open .htaccess from your editor and edit:
    define('URL', '');
    define('LIBS', 'app/providers/');
    define('INC', 'inc/');

    define('DB_TYPE', 'mysql');
    define('DB_HOST', '');
    define('DB_NAME', '');
    define('DB_USER', '');
    define('DB_PASS', '');
    3. Open controller folder and create a folder in name of your new url eg: http://mvc-php/home. Your new created folder will be named home and create an index file using same example in the index file located in the controller folder. 
    
    4. Apply same step to create your model.
    5. Apply same step in creating your view.
    
    Please Note: This is just a simple MVC works... There are still more to do with it.
    Thanks... Femi
